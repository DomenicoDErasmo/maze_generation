- [ ] Edge abstraction for constant CELL_STEP.mul calls
- [ ] Implement Kruskal's algorithm
    - [ ] Store disjoint sets of cells
    - [ ] For each edge (how to order?), if the edge joins two disjoint sets
      - [ ] Fill in a cell between the two sets at the edge 
      - [ ] Union the disjoint sets
